# Android Stocks App

This Android Stocks App is a native mobile application designed to display live stock market data and provide users with a simple way to track and explore individual stocks. The app integrates with an external API to fetch market information and uses modern Android development practices to keep the UI responsive and the data flow clean.

Users can browse stocks on the home screen, open detailed views for individual tickers, and create a personalized watchlist for quick access. Each screen—from the home feed to the detail view and watchlist—is backed by its own ViewModel to keep responsibilities clear and maintain a predictable data flow. This project highlights practical Android development fundamentals: REST API integration, structured UI components, activity/fragment navigation, adapter-based rendering, and clean separation between UI, data, and business logic. It represents a complete, end-to-end implementation of a small but realistic mobile application that fetches and displays dynamic data.
